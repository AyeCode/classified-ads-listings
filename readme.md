Notes:
@todo: Unable to specify z-index.
@todo: When attempting to apply bg-primary to 'BS > shape divider', it fails to work as expected, instead defaulting to the standard Bootstrap bg-primary. To resolve this issue, I needed to utilize a custom color.
@todo: No way to control fields border in 'BS > contact form'
@todo: No way to control shadow opacity
@todo: The automatic addition of the bg-white class to category icon links is unintended and should be avoided.
